# The Green Energy Revolution

The Green Energy Revolution is a global transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and geothermal power. 
One of the primary goals of this transition is to reduce carbon emissions and combat climate change. 

Solar energy is captured using photovoltaic panels, which convert sunlight directly into electricity. 
Wind energy is harnessed by large turbines located in areas with high wind speeds, such as coastal regions or open plains.

Despite its benefits, the transition faces challenges including energy storage limitations and the high initial cost of infrastructure.
However, governments around the world are providing subsidies to encourage the adoption of green technologies.
